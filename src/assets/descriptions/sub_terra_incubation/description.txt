Sub Terra Incubation is the fourth modular expansion for Sub Terra, introducing a new character, the Scavenger, as well as a brand new horrible thing to deal with, horror spawn. Faster but weaker than their fully grown cousins, these disgusting little blighters hatch from sticky, amniotic eggs that grow in the corners of the eery caves in Sub Terra.

Interact with them at your peril...

New tiles, new horrors, a new character. Incubation adds another chapter to your Sub Terra adventures!
